##Inssidious
###A uniquely frustrating wireless network

![](http://inssidious.com/img/Inssidious_Alpha.png)

Inssidious reproduces the real world, oddly broken, network conditions that users see all the time but are otherwise incredibly difficult to create when developing mobile apps.

From any laptop, Inssidious broadcasts a new wireless network. Connect a phone, and at the click of a button you can slow the network speed, introduce random network problems, block internet access, specific servers, web services, and more.

###Requirements

Inssidious runs on any system running Windows 7 or newer with a wireless adapter, including laptops, desktops, and virtual machines (if you pass through a physical wireless adapter).
